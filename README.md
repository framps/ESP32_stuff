1. LCD_Dimmer: Dim an LCD with SW instead of a potentiometer. Does not work with I2C driven LCD :-(. May work with native LCDs.
2. BlinkNotification: Simple class which allows to create any LED blink patterns for status and error notifications if there is no other way to pass this information to the outside world (e.g. LCD) ([Demovideo](https://www.linux-tips-and-tricks.de/BlinkNotification.mp4))
